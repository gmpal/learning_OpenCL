/* OPENCL Extension and more */

OpenCL vendors provides some extensions we can include in the OpenCL kernels, for example, to print some debug information. 

All extensions in OpenCL follow the syntax (to be written in the kernel) 
# pragma OPENCL EXTENSION extension_name : behavior

For example: printf() is a non-standard OpenCL function. To enable it: 

	Extension for Intel OpenCL: 
		# pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_intel_printf :enable

	Extension for AMD APP OpenCL:
		# pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_amd_printf :enable
